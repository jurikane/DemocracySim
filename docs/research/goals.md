**DemocracySim** is a multi-agent simulation framework designed to explore the effects of different voting rules on democratic participation and welfare. 
Its broader aim is to be able to include complex and diverse factors via simulation to investigate how collective decision-making processes can be improved. 
With a focus on agent-based modeling, the simulation ties together elements of participatory dynamics, resource allocation, and group decision effects in a controlled, evolving system.

## Research Questions

DemocracySim seeks to answer several critical questions:

- Do different voting procedures produce varying dynamics, and if so, how?
- How do minority and majority agent types behave in collective decision-making?
- What are the long-term effects of (non-)participation on the system?
- How does wealth distribution impact participation and welfare in the simulation?

## Broader Implications

This project offers a controlled testbed for understanding the complex interplay of individual and collective interest in democratic systems. DemocracySim has the potential to reveal valuable insights into real-world voting dynamics.
