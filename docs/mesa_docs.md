### A Python Library for Agent-Based Modeling

Mesa[^1] is a Python library designed for creating agent-based models (ABMs)[^2]. 
It provides tools to define, run, and visualize models in which individual entities, called agents, interact within an environment (the model). 
Mesa is highly flexible, allowing to simulate complex systems and observe emergent behaviors arising from simple rules.

### Agent-Based Modeling and Complex Societal Questions

Multi-agent based simulation is a valuable tool to research voting rules and collective decision-making
as it allows for the modeling of very complex interactions that are challenging to capture with traditional methods[^3].
ABM is mainly used to research and analyze complex relationships. 
The focus is on understanding how individual behaviors and interactions lead to collective outcomes. 
It is often used in fields like social sciences, economics, 
and environmental science to model and analyze scenarios that are impractical to study otherwise.
