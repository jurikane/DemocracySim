    processes ("elections"). It incorporates voting agents with personalities,
    color cells (grid fields), and areas (election territories). This model is
    designed to analyze different voting rules and their impact.

    This class provides mechanisms for creating and managing cells, agents,
    and areas, along with data collection for analysis. Colors in the model
    mutate depending on a predefined mutation rate and are influenced by
    elections. Agents interact based on their personalities, knowledge, and
    experiences.

        grid (mesa.space.SingleGrid): Grid representing the environment
            with a single occupancy per cell (the color).
        height (int): The height of the grid.
        width (int): The width of the grid.
        colors (ndarray): Array containing the unique color identifiers.
        voting_rule (Callable): A function defining the social welfare
            function to aggregate agent preferences. This callable typically
            takes agent rankings as input and returns a single aggregate result.
        distance_func (Callable): A function used to calculate a
